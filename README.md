# VPN Web Application
This is a web application designed for managing VPN services provided by a VPN service provider company. The application allows administrators to register, add service providers, and associate countries with the service providers. Users can register themselves, subscribe to a service provider, and connect to a VPN service in a specific country. Users can also communicate with each other, provided they are in the same country or connected to a VPN in the same country.

## High-Level Requirements
The following are the key requirements of the VPN web application:

- Administrators can:
  - Register themselves using the registerAdmin endpoint.
  - Add service providers using the addServiceProvider endpoint.
  - Add countries to the service providers using the addCountry endpoint.

- Users can:
  - Register themselves using the registerUser endpoint.
  - Subscribe to a service provider using the subscribe endpoint.
  - Connect to a VPN service in a specific country using the connect endpoint.
  - Disconnect from the VPN using the disconnect endpoint.
  - Establish communication with other users using the communicate endpoint.
    
## API Endpoints
The VPN web application uses a RESTful API approach with the following controllers and endpoints:

### AdminController
- `/register` - POST request to register a new administrator.
- `/addProvider` - POST request to add a new service provider.
- `/addCountry` - POST request to add a country to a service provider.
### UserController
- `/register` - POST request to register a new user.
- `/subscribe` - PUT request to subscribe a user to a service provider.
### ConnectionController
- `/connect` - POST request to connect a user to a VPN service in a specific country.
- `/disconnect` - DELETE request to disconnect a user from the VPN.
- `/communicate` - GET request to establish communication between users.
